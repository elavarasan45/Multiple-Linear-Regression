## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 


In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Conclusions
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes can focus more on Temperature
- We can see demand for bikes was more in 2019 than 2018, so demand will more for coming years as reach of the company increases.
- Can focus more on Summer & Winter season, August, September month, Weekends, Working days as they have good influence on bike sharing.
- We can see spring season has negative coefficients and negatively correlated to bike rentals. So we can reduce the number of bike during winter season.
